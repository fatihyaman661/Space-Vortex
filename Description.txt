This is a very early level of a dream which is yet to be perfected a lot.

This program will one day be a very large and capable open source program which does static analysis. One day, it may even do cfd or heat analysis as well. We shall see.

It's main aim is aerospace structures, yet theoratically it will be able to be used for any type of application.

It will only use open source stuff. Starting with julia and its packages.
