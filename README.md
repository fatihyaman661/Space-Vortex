# Space-Vortex
An open source analysis program

This program will one day become a very extensive analysis program or will be dumped to rot. Hopefully the first one. 

I will also explain how to manage the code. How I did things that I did one day if it gets a little more complicated to directly understand. For now it is the comments who will do the job.
